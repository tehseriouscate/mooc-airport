The purpose of this exercise was to make an application to manage an airport, with its airplanes and flights. As far as the planes are concerned, we always know their ID and capacity. As for the flights, we know the plane used for the flight, the departure airport code (for instance HEL) and the destination airport code (for instance BAL).
